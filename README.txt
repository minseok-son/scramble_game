Frontend dependencies: autoprefixer, eslint, eslint-config-next, next, postcss, react, react-dom, tailwindcss
Backend dependencies: axios, body-parser, cors, express

How to run the code:
After installing all the dependencies, start the backend server by running npm start on the backend folder console. 
To start the frontend enter npm run build first and then run npm start. If everything worked succesfully up to this point,
the game should be hosted on localhost:3000

Brief:
I think I am generally satisifed with the code I produced. I think there are some refactoring that needs to be done
to make it more organized and extendable. Given more time and experience, I also think it would have been better to
write the code in typescript. I also have no clue what ekreb is but my guess would be breek just because it sounds like a word.
